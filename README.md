# CSC111-FinalProject
Final project for CSC111

The L Game is an abstract strategy game involving two players whose goal is to win by leaving the other player to make a move. Invented by Edward de Bono, the L Game is played on a 4 by 4 board, with each playing have a 3 by 2 "L" shape piece and with two neutral 1 by 1 pieces taking up 2 of the 16 boardspaces.

Our goal is thus to make a simple AI for playing the L Game, and to allow for human players to play against this AI. We have chosen this goal as our group members share a passion for strategy games. Our strategy will involve the use of MiniMax, Alpha-Beta pruning and Monte Carlo Search Trees.
